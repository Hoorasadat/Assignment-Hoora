            History of Maui:
        </h2>

        <p>
            &quot;When Captain James Cook first arrived in 1778 h was welcomed by long ago migrated Polynesians which
            lived
            in
            established communities lead by the Kamehameha royal family. Modern Hawaiian history began in the
            mid-1700s.
            King Kamehameha I took up residence (and later made his capital) in Lahaina after conquering Maui in 1790.
            Within a few years, the American missionaries came to the islands to spread Christianity. The royal family
            developed pineapple and sugar cane plantations and workers from other countries were imported as contract
            labourers. The Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893 by a group of American businessmen. In 1898 the
            United
            States annexed the islands and declared them a state in 1959.
            Maui was used by the army as a staging center, training base, and for rest and relaxation during World War
            II.&quot;
